In this game, you are the cyan colored block. Your goal is relatively simple- find the dark blue colored block, go to the next level, and go through as many mazes within five minutes. You are almost blind- you can only see so many squares around you. There are also red blocks in your way that teleport you around the map, which can either be helpful- sometimes the only way to solve a maze- or disastrous. There are also magenta colored power up blocks that increase your range of vision, which can be extremely helpful. However, these will only work on the floor that you are on. To add to the challenge, the passages get longer and wind more, the power up blocks decrease in number, and the number of warp panels increase in number as the game goes on. After solving a maze, you are presented with a brand new, randomly generated maze with loops in it, and you gain a point. 

The Endless Maze Generation is based off an algorithm called “Recursive Backtracking Maze Generation”.
